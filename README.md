## About Me
I am a self-taught software engineer whos background spans a number of different industries. Though I graduated with a degree in Mathematics, I have always had a passion for technology and ended up teaching myself how to code my last semester of college. From there I have worked in a number of different industries and projects, from numerical analysis in finance, web development in healthcare and news, site reliability in media, and now cloud computing in fintech. 

### Skill Set
I've worked across the entire stack from front-end, back-end, devops, security, and networking. My strengths lie in Cloud Architecture, DevOps, and Backend Development. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as an engineer.
